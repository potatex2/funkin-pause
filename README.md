# Haxe Wallpaper for Lively Wallpaper
Oh, hey. You found another one of my hyperfixations lurking in the Internet. Well done.

Now, what *exactly* does this one have in store for us?

## Overview
**Please note:** I'm too damn broke to get Wallpaper Engine, HOWEVER Lively Wallpaper works very similar to that software, so this will be the focus for this repo.

This repo contains Haxe files for an interactive wallpaper that is currently based on a customized Psych Engine (RIP 03/31/2025) pause substate*

<sup>*PauseSubState.hx based off of [version 0.7.3](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/releases/tag/0.7.3)</sup>

To prevent interactivity issues, keyboard inputs are not allowed or set as defined in Project.xml. You can enable them by commenting out `<haxedef name="FLX_NO_KEYBOARD" />`, but **make suer your desktop icons are set to hidden**.

## How do I apply it?
In order to use this wallpaper, you're obviously going to need [the software](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively) itself. **It is important that you use the INSTALLER VERSION instead of the Microsoft Store version, as there are compatibility differences present between each of them.**
